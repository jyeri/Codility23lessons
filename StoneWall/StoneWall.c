// You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters long, and its thickness should be constant; 
// however, it should have different heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified by an array H of N positive integers. 
// H[I] is the height of the wall from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end. 
// In particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.
// 
// The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such blocks are rectangular). 
// Your task is to compute the minimum number of blocks needed to build the wall.

// First idea is just forget everything i read, and thinking that everytime height changes, i need a new block, yes?
// no...
