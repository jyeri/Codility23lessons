//A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters A, C, G and T, 
//which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence. 
//Each nucleotide has an impact factor, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types A, C, G and T have impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 
//You are going to answer several queries of the form: What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?
//
//The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting of N characters. 
//There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers. 
//The K-th query (0 â‰¤ K < M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).


// General understanding: We compare S from P[x] to Q[x]; x++, and find smallest value "genome"
// A = 1
// C = 2
// G = 3
// T = 4

// S = seq
// P AND Q = indexes
// M = Length of arr (number of queries)

// first thought would we just to check S[P[x]] to S[Q[x]] and hold the lowest one found.
// problem with this is effiency, we would need to iterate everytime we get new query. does it matter?
