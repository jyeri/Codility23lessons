// We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N − 1. An array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given. 
// The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].
// 
// We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain their borders).
// 
// The figure below shows discs drawn for N = 6 and A as follows:
// 
//   A[0] = 1
//   A[1] = 5
//   A[2] = 2
//   A[3] = 1
//   A[4] = 4
//   A[5] = 0
// 
// 
// There are eleven (unordered) pairs of discs that intersect, namely:
// 
// discs 1 and 4 intersect, and both intersect with all the other discs;
// disc 2 also intersects with discs 0 and 3.
