// A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.
// 
// Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
// 
// 0 represents a car traveling east,
// 1 represents a car traveling west.
// The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.


// First thoughts:
// if we have to know specifig car pairs delete this, but if just number of passing ones: we could should just count number of cars going E and number of cars going West
// then its simply E(X) * W + E(X) * W(X->)

// second idea: everytime we find same direction car, we pump up icrementation by one, and keep adding the pump number till the end.
// 90%, problem with two cars. (this is wrong in the test since it should be 1 when they pass any either 0,1 or 1,0 and 0 when they go same direction) can fix if we just start
// the count in first car heading EAST, instead of counting first car no matter direction.
